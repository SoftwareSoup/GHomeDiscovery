Project Original Name: Get Off My GHome
Project Name: GHome Discovery

Description: Using a raspberry pi and the Google Home device (my set-up: Google Home Mini), 
	this program will create a server that can get, process, and respond to Google Home 
	requests. 
	
Main Goal: Allow the google home to respond to connected device queries. The program will
	also keep track of previously connected devices so that information on newer devices 
	can also be aquired.
	
Stretch Goals: Expand the project past Network discovery and allow the google home to interface
	with more of my household personal projects to create a more automated home environment.
